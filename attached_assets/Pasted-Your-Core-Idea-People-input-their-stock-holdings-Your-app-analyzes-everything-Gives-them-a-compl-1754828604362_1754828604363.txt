Holdings Table:
- holding_id (primary key)
- portfolio_id (foreign key)
- stock_symbol (like AAPL, GOOGL)
- quantity
- purchase_price
- purchase_date

Stock_Data Table:
- symbol (primary key)
- company_name
- current_price
- pe_ratio, market_cap, sector
- last_updated (for caching)
2. Backend Server Architecture
Tech Stack Options:

Node.js + Express (easiest for beginners)
